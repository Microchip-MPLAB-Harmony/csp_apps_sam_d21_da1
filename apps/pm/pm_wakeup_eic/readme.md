# PM wakeup using EIC

This application demonstrates entering the low power modes and exiting it using the EIC.

## Description

The PM peripheral library is used to enter the low power mode and the device exits low power mode when the button is pressed. To identify a button push, the EIC is configured to detect a falling edge on the GPIO pin connected to the switch.
