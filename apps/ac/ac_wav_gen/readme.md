# AC PWM generation

This example application shows how to use the Analog Comparator Peripheral library to generate a 1KHz PWM waveform.

## Description

The AC peripheral is configured to generate analog PWM waveform by comparing the sine wave generated from the DAC with the reference voltage selected as a VDD scaler. The duty cycle of the analog PWM is changed by pressing a switch which changes the value of the VDD scaler.

### Setting up [SAM D21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd21-xpro)

- Connect a jumper between pin PA04 (Pin 17 of the EXT1 ) and PA02 (Pin 3 of the EXT3 header)
- Use the Logic Analyzer/Oscilloscope and probe PA12 pin (Pin 7 of the EXT3 header) to observe the PWM output
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting up [SAM DA1 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMDA1-XPRO)

- Connect a jumper between pin PA04 (Pin 17 of the EXT1 ) and PA02 (Pin 3 of the EXT3 header)
- Use the Logic Analyzer/Oscilloscope and probe PA12 pin (Pin 7 of the EXT3 header) to observe the PWM output
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Observe output message in console as follows (*NOTE: Pin numbers will vary as per the device*):
